# crypto-network
In this project we create a network for long-lived cryptocurrencies from January 2020 to March 2022. Then we use well-known network science metrics and tools to study the evolution of this network, and the effect of external events on it. Additionally, we study the effects of bull-bear market cycles on the network and also investigate the evolution of the cross-correlations between different groups of cryptocurrencies.
